# State of the Helix

## Current Vector
**The Strategic Helix methodology, when applied to itself, can create a self-improving system for venture development.**

## Cycle 1: Formalize the Foundation

### Phase 1: Observe
* **What has changed, and what is the most important truth we need to learn right now?**
  > The project is a blank slate. The most important truth to learn is whether we can create a tangible, observable artifact of the Helix methodology itself.

### Phase 2: Build
* **What is the fastest, cheapest experiment we can run to answer our most important question?**
  > Create the initial project structure, including the `STATE_OF_THE_HELIX.md` document and a simple dashboard to visualize it.

### Phase 3: Criticize
* **Did the experiment's result validate or invalidate our hypothesis? What did we learn?**
  > Does the initial setup clearly reflect the principles of the Strategic Helix? Is it a solid foundation for future cycles?

### Phase 4: Decide
* **Based on what we just learned, what is our next move?**
  > Persevere. The next step is to build upon this foundation.
